Once upon a time there was a little red hen who lived on a farm
She found some wheat seeds and asked her friends for help to plant them
The dog said no the cat said no and the duck said no
So the little red hen planted the seeds all by herself
When the wheat was ready she asked who will help me cut the wheat
Again nobody wanted to help her so she did it herself
Then she asked who will help me grind the wheat into flour
Still nobody helped so she ground it herself
Finally she baked fresh bread and asked who will help me eat this bread
Suddenly everyone wanted to help but the little red hen said no
I will eat it myself because I did all the work
